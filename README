What's in here
--------------

apportionment.rb   - library for computing apportionment by either the
		     Equal Proportions method (current law) or the
		     Fair Share (Hamilton) method; also includes some
		     static data representing the 2010 Census, 2014
		     population estimates, and the actual results of the
		     2010 apportionment
at_large_states    - computes how large the House of Representatives would
		     need to be in order to give a second seat to each of 
		     the states currently represented with a single
		     (at-large) seat
test_apportionment - test harness, uses Census 2010 data to compute the
		     2010 apportionment and compares this to the actual
		     results; follow comments to see changes in various
		     scenarios (DC, PR statehood, 2014 census estimates,
		     etc.)
